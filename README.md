## Abstract
This is an outdated abstract for our project, instead of comparing interest rates to housing prices we're comparing California housing prices by their location.

According to "Twelve of the Top 25 Highest Cost U.S. Cities Are in California" by CBS News from October of 2023, San Diego was listed as the #1 most expensive city in the United States [1]. This high cost of living is greatly impacted by interest rates - with higher interest rates, it costs more to borrow and spend money. Studies have shown that interest rates have an inverse relationship with housing prices [2]. However, more work is needed to study the relationship between interest rates and home ownership, specifically in the U.S. real estate market. Understanding the U.S. housing market is important because it comprises a significant portion of the U.S. economy [3]. Any changes in governmental policy relating to the housing and mortgage markets could have wide-ranging effects and thus should be well understood. Predictive modeling may help inform future policy changes by providing a data-informed approach to estimating possible outcomes. We will leverage the following datasets to study this relationship and ultimately produce a model that can predict home ownership percentage for a given interest rate.
